# 📊 BenchmarkMapping

This repository contains a benchmark comparison between AutoMapper and Riok Mapperly, mapping libraries in the .NET ecosystem.

The goal is to evaluate the performance of both libraries when mapping a large number of objects.

⚙️ What’s Inside
✅ Console app built with .NET
✅ Source and destination classes with multiple properties
✅ BenchmarkDotNet integration
✅ Comparative tests mapping 100,000 objects

📌 Why this matters
After the announcement that AutoMapper will adopt a commercial license, many developers are looking for lightweight and more efficient alternatives.
Mapperly, by generating mapping code at compile time, offers significant performance advantages compared to AutoMapper’s runtime reflection-based approach.
